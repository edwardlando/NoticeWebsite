</p>
<p>
    These terms of use (these “Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Notice LLC (“Notice”) mobile application (the “Application”), including any
    content, functionality and services offered on or through the Application, so please read them carefully before using the Application.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>By using the Application, you agree to be bound and abide by these Terms and our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated herein by reference</strong>
    . You also represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with Notice and are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so. If you do
    not meet these requirements, you must not access or use the Application.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1. Description of Application. </strong>
    Notice is a social media application that allows you to post anonymously your thoughts, observations, insights and advice, as well as photos and graphics,
    for viewing and comment by other users of the Application (“Users”). Currently the User community is restricted to U.S. college and university students and
    others with a valid U.S. college or university email address; however, in the future, we may expand the User community to U.S. high school students and
    others. We are constantly improving the Application and adding new features, so what the Application looks like today may change tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2. License to Application.</strong>
    The Application is owned by Notice and is protected by United States and international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other intellectual
    property or proprietary rights laws. You are granted a limited, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Application, subject to these Terms and in
    compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and any agreements or terms with third parties to which you are subject.
</p>
<p>
    Notice has the sole authority and discretion to license the Application to you. The Application license is governed not only by these Terms, but by the
    Apple End User License Agreement that applies when you download this application from the iTunes Store or any other license terms that may apply if you
    download this application from another service provider (collectively, “Other Agreements”). These Terms amend and supplement the Other Agreements, and to
    the extent these Terms contradict or are inconsistent with the Other Agreements, these Terms control and prevail. We reserve the right to change, modify
    and update the Application at any time for any reason, with or without advance notice to you. We also reserve the right, in our sole discretion, (i) to
    refuse service to anyone, (ii) to discontinue or suspend the Application at any time, and (iii) to deny you access to the Application due to your
    objectionable conduct or practices, complaints about you from other Users or members of the public, or for any other reason.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>27. Digital Millennium Copyright Act</strong>
    . The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “<strong>DMCA</strong>”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on
    the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that Content transmitted via the Application infringes your
    copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that we remove the Content or block access to it. Such notice should include the following
    information: (i) an electronic or physical signature of the owner (or person authorized to act on behalf of the owner) of the copyrighted work; (ii) a
    description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed upon; (iii) information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the copyrighted
    work; (iv) your address, telephone number, and e-mail address; (v) a statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not
    authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your
    notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf. If you believe in good faith that someone has
    wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the
    then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. Notices and counter-notices may be sent to our designated Copyright Agent solely at the following
    email address:support@trynotice.com.
</p>
<p>
    We reserve the right at our sole discretion to suspend, terminate or disconnect any User’s access to and use of the Application if we suspect that such
    User has engaged in copyright infringement.
</p>
